This is a simple program to multiply matrices using a given number of threads made by Trent Haines for Operating Systems Project 2. The two matrices are given by specified input files, and their dimensions are passed along as command line arguments. The program can be compiled using the make command in linux with the given makefile and cpp file in the working directory, and then ran by using the format: ./matmult u v w input1.txt input2.txt output.txt #ofThread, where the first input matrix is of dimensions u x v and the second input matrix is of dimensions v x w. The program utilizes threads up until there are as many threads as rows, in which case it limits the number of threads so that rows do not have to be split up by thread.
